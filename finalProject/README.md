# Final - Journal

### Early Concept (March)

**Location relative to clock:** on the floor? Maybe down where the 6 would be or maybe off to the side.

**Base:** I would like it to not have a base. I would like all the mechanisms to be hidden inside the hug-bot, so maybe the inside needs a lot of bases and supports, but I would like the bot itself to support via the "legs".

**Motors:** A stepper motor for the head poppin up, another stepper motor (or maybe two?) for the arms moving outwards from the body, and two servo motors for the arms closing in on the person.

**Fabrication of parts:** Great question... I think what I wonder is how possible is it to make curves happen and then what is the tools that I would need for that to happen.

**What materials will you use:** Aluminum?

**Different levels of activity:** The head slowly comes up until its intended time when it is fully up and then it can give hugs. Maybe from that moment onwards it starts to close and if it closes all the way without receiving a hug it gets sad or something. Maybe it can give multiple hugs during the given time frame and the more hugs it gives something special happens.
